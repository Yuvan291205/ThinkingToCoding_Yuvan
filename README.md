## Steps involved:

```
1.Where we are using #include<stdio.h> which includes the input,output as well as printf

2.where every C program starts from int main() where it return the integer value

3. by using the printf we are proceeding

```

## Code :
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("The Sequence Thinker – The Robot Tea Maker\n");

    printf("Step 1: Take a kettle and fill it with water.\n");
    printf("Step 2: Switch on the stove and place the kettle on i.\n");
    printf("Step 3: Wait until the water starts boiling.\n");
    printf("Step 4: Add tea leaves to the boiling water.\n");
    printf("Step 5: Add sugar as per taste.\n");
    printf("Step 6: Pour some milk into the mixture.\n");
    printf("Step 7: Allow the tea to boil for a few minutes.\n");
    printf("Step 8: Turn off the stove.\n");
    printf("Step 9: Use a strainer to filter the tea into a cup.\n");
    printf("Step 10: Serve the hot tea.\n");

    printf("\nTea making process completed successfully!\n");

    return 0;
}
```
